## Overview

_**Apartment Fix** is a web app to document apartment issues, such as leaking plumbing, broken sheetrock, etc. The building manager will inturn login and leave comments, such as when a contractor will arrive. The contractor can also login and take an image of the resolution. If the tenant approves the work, they can mark the issue as resolved._


<br>

## MVP

_The **Apartment Fix** MVP will allow for the creation of an apartment issue with an image and description. Then full CRUD functionality will be implimented thru the addition, editing, and deletion of comments to the specific issue. Users can also be created with encrypted passwords, who will also be allowed to leave comments on the specific apartment issue._

- _Phasellus dapibus fermentum risus vitae bibendum._
- _Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex._
- _etc._

### Libraries and Dependencies

> Use this section to list all supporting libraries and dependencies, and their role in the project. Below is an example - this needs to be replaced!

| :--------------: | :----------------------------------------- |
|      React       | _Javascript library for an interactive UI_ |

### Client (Front End)

#### Wireframes

> Use the Wireframes section to display desktop, tablet and mobile views. No hand-drawn wireframes. Use a tool like wireframe.cc, Whimsical or AdobeXD

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. 

#### Component Hierarchy

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Component Breakdown

> Use this section to go into further depth regarding your components, including breaking down the components as stateless or stateful, and considering the passing of data between those components.

|  Component   |    Type    | state | props | Description                                                      |
| :----------: | :--------: | :---: | :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Header    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The header will contain the navigation and logo._               |
|  Navigation  | functional |   n   |   n   | _The navigation will provide a link to each of the pages._       |
|   Gallery    |   class    |   y   |   n   | _The gallery will render the posts using cards in flexbox._      |
| Gallery Card | functional |   n   |   y   | _The cards will render the post info via props._                 |
|    Footer    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The footer will show info about me and a link to my portfolio._ |

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._
