## Code Showcase

Built a service to handle file uploading to Cloudinary.
After creating an account and entering the Preset and Server Name into your .env file.
All you have to do is pass the imagedata/file/URL to the "uploadImg" service, 
then a URL of the image location on Cloudinary is returned.

```
import axios from "axios";

export const uploadImg = async (imgData) => {
  try {
    const data = new FormData();

    data.append("file", imgData);
    data.append("upload_preset", process.env.REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_PRESET);
    const URLCloud = `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/${process.env.REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_SERVER_NAME}/upload`;
    const resCloud = await axios.post(URLCloud, data);
    if (resCloud.data.secure_url) {
      return resCloud.data.secure_url;
    } else {
      return "failed upload";
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
